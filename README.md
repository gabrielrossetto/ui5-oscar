## ðŸ“‘ Documentation

### Architecture

#### Component-based Structure
The application follows the MVC (Model-View-Controller) pattern and is organized into distinct files and folders:

- app/controller/: Contains controllers managing UI logic.
- app/view/: Holds XML views defining UI layouts.
- app/model/: Manages data models.
- app/css/: Contains custom styling.
- app/: Houses the main Component.js, manifest.json, and the entry index.html.

#### Data Flow
The application retrieves, updates, and manages award data through OData v4 services:

Fetches awards, actors, films, and categories from an OData service.

Uses UI5 models to bind and structure data in views.

Implements event-based communication to update UI after data modifications.

## Core Components

### Component.js (Entry Point)
Initializes the UI5 application.

Loads the OData models for awards, actors, films, and categories.

Sets up i18n (internationalization) model.

Loads style.css dynamically.

Initializes the UI5 router for navigation.

### Manifest.json (Configuration & Routing)
Defines metadata, UI5 dependencies, and model configurations.

Configures routing using sap.m.routing.Router with defined routes:

- Main (Home Page)
- AwardForm (Award creation/editing page)
- Declares the data source (/odata/v4/oscar/).

### Main Controller (Main.controller.js)
Loads and manages winners' data, fetching award details with expanded actor, film, and category references.

Implements search functionality using UI5 filters.

Handles event-based updates when new awards are added.

Navigates to the award creation/editing screen.

### Award Form Controller (AwardForm.controller.js)
Handles award creation and editing.

Loads existing award data or initializes a new entry.

Performs API calls (fetch requests) for saving and updating awards.

Utilizes the EventBus to notify the application of changes.

### Models (models.js)
Provides helper methods to retrieve and create JSON models.

Retrieves UI5's i18n model for localization support.

## UI Implementation
### Main View (Main.view.xml)
Displays a searchable and clickable table of awards.

Uses SAP UI5 Table (sap.m.Table) with data binding to winnersDetailed model.

Allows users to navigate to the Award Form for editing or creating awards.

### Award Form View (AwardForm.view.xml)
Contains dropdowns for selecting actors, films, and categories.

Provides Save and Cancel buttons.

Uses UI5 VBox for form layout.

Binds form data to the award model.

## Key Features & Design Choices

### OData v4 Usage
The application consumes OData v4 services to interact with the backend.

Uses $expand for fetching related entities (actors, films, categories).

Implements CRUD operations via fetch.

### Event-driven Updates
Implements EventBus (AwardsChannel) to refresh data dynamically when a new award is added.

Avoids unnecessary API calls by updating only the relevant parts of the UI.

### Model Binding & Separation of Concerns
Uses JSONModel for UI state management.

Separates logic into reusable helper methods (models.js).

### Routing & Navigation

Implements pattern-based navigation (awardForm/:awardId:).

Uses sap.ui.core.UIComponent.getRouterFor() to navigate dynamically.

### Internationalization (i18n)

Uses an i18n model for language support.

Dynamically updates button labels and UI texts.

### Custom Styling (style.css)

Provides minor UI enhancements:

Custom bar background.

Bold headers.

Rounded buttons.
